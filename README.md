- 👋 Hi, I’m @MotoMonkey2
- 👀 I’m interested in LED and other lighting and lazers..

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, not sure I'd be much of an asset on any project yet. I'm so very new to all of this.
- 📫 How to reach me ...  that's a good question. I haven't figured out the whole social media thing yet.... would really like to get a digital presence of some sort.

- 😄 Pronouns: ...the usual group 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
